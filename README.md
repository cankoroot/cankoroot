Hi, I'm Burak Can 👋  
I'm a front-end web developer focused on building modern, responsive, and user-friendly websites.

I specialize in creating landing pages, corporate websites, and custom UI-focused projects using clean and maintainable code.  
My goal is to deliver fast, visually strong, and scalable web solutions.

### Core Technologies
- HTML5 (Semantic, accessible layouts)
- CSS3 (Flexbox, Grid, responsive design, animations)
- JavaScript (ES6+, DOM, API integration)
